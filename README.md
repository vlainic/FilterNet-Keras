# FilterNet-Keras

For details on the FilterNet see its [original repository](https://github.com/Openmail/FilterNet).

Here is my attempt to make the Keras version of the FilterNet.

*Note: I know it is not optimized for the fastest calculation with something as fastai in the original code. This is ongoing work and updates are possible. Also advices and comments are welcome :)*
