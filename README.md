# FilterNet-Keras

For details on the FilterNet see its [original repository](https://github.com/Openmail/FilterNet).

Here I shere the attempt to make the Keras version of the FilterNet. There is only model, not dataset or compiling-fitting part.

*Note: I know it is not optimized for the fastest calculation with something as* fastai *in the original code. This is ongoing work and updates are possible. Also advices and comments are welcome :)*
